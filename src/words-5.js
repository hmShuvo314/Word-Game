Introduction
Your Vocabulary Has Been Talking About You
Behind Your Back
The words you use say a lot about you. Knowing which words to use and
understanding how to use them are both key to communicating effectively and
accurately. People often say in frustration, “I know what I mean, but I don’t know how to
say it.” If the right words aren’t there, the right ideas can’t get through. Your vocabulary
is the foundation of your ability to share your thoughts with other people. When you
improve your vocabulary, you improve your ability to bring your intelligence and ideas
to bear on the world around you.
“Big” Words Aren’t Necessarily Better
When people say that someone has a “good vocabulary,” they usually mean that he or
she uses a lot of important-sounding words—words like . But a vocabulary consisting of words like these isn’t necessarily a “good”
vocabulary. Why?
Because almost no one knows what  mean. If you
used these words in conversation, chances are no one listening to you would know
what you were talking about. Big, difficult words have important uses, but improving a
vocabulary involves much more than merely decorating your speech or your writing
with a few polysyllabic zingers.
The goal of communication is clarity. We write and speak in order to make ourselves
understood. A good vocabulary is one that makes communication easy and efficient.
One mark of an effective speaker or writer is his or her ability to express complex ideas
with relatively simple words.
Most discourse among educated people is built on words that are fairly ordinary—
words you’ve heard before, even if you aren’t exactly certain what they mean. The best
way to improve your vocabulary isn’t to comb the dictionary for a handful of tongue
twisters to throw at unsuspecting strangers. Instead, you need to hone your
understanding of words that turn up again and again in intelligent communication. A
person who had a clear understanding of every word in an issue of the -
Times or the Wall Street Journal would have a powerful vocabulary—a vocabulary
sophisticated enough to impress almost any teacher, admissions officer, colleague, or
employer.
Why You Need This Book
An effective vocabulary is one that enables you to convey ideas easily. Do you know
what inveterate means? Do you know the difference between flaunt and flout? Do you
know why an artist might be insulted if you called his or her work artful?
None of these words is particularly difficult. But each has its own meaning or meanings.
If you misuse these words, you communicate that you are in over your head.
When people get into trouble with words, it usually isn’t because they don’t know the
meaning of a seldom-used word like termagant but because they are confused about
the meaning of a much more common word—a word they hear, read, and even use
with regularity.
Take the word peruse, for example. Many people think that it means “skim” or “glance
over.” But it doesn’t. In fact, it means very nearly the opposite. To peruse a document is
to read it carefully.
The number of words you know is less important than the care you take in learning the
ones you really use. Speaking or writing well doesn’t require an enormous vocabulary
—but it does require a confident one. And the way to gain confidence in your
vocabulary is to buckle down and learn the words you need to make yourself clearly
understood.
The Princeton Review Approach
The philosophy behind The Princeton Review is simple: We teach what you need to
know and try to make it interesting and fun at the same time. In preparing students for
various standardized tests, we spend much of our time working on vocabulary. Despite
what many people think, many “intelligence” or “aptitude” tests are largely tests of
vocabulary. The students who earn high scores on such tests are the students who
know the right words. The success of our method is in part a result of our success in
teaching vocabulary.
The methods we have developed are easy to use and, we believe, extremely effective.
There’s nothing particularly startling about them because they rely mostly on common
sense, but they do work. And although they were developed primarily for students,
these methods can be used by anyone who wants to build a stronger, smarter
vocabulary.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into three main sections. In Chapter 1, we describe some basic
principles of vocabulary building. We also explain techniques for learning new words.
You should apply these techniques as you work through the rest of the book. The more
carefully you work, the more rapidly you’ll enhance your ability to use words effectively.
The heart of Word Smart is Chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 2 is the largest section of the
book, containing all of the words we think the savvy student should know. Each word is
accompanied by a definition and one or more examples intended to help you
understand how to use the word properly. Many entries also include discussions of
related words as well as additional meanings or associations. Scattered throughout the
book are quick quizzes that will help you strengthen your vocabulary skills and assess
your progress as you work. The answers to these quick quizzes are found in Chapter
13.
Chapter 3 consists of “The Final Exam” covering all the words in Chapter 2. You can
use this test to help firm up your new vocabulary knowledge and to help ensure that
you’ll retain all the new words you’ve learned. You can also use the test as a diagnostic
tool. By trying your hand at the questions before working your way through the book,
you’ll give yourself a good idea of which words cause you the most trouble. And if
you’re preparing for a major standardized test such as the SAT or GRE, you and your
friends can use the Final Exam as a handy review device. All of the answers to the
drills in this section can be found in Chapter 13.
The third and final section of this book, Chapters 4 through 12, contain specialized lists
of words, including need-to-know words for the SAT and GRE. These lists, which
contain the most frequently tested (or appearing) words on the SAT and GRE, are the
ones we use to help students boost their verbal scores on these exams. Sometimes
simply knowing that a particular word is included on one of these lists is enough to lead
students to a correct answer on the test.
Other specialized lists include frequently misused words, useful foreign words and
phrases, common abbreviations, and words associated with science, finance, and the
arts. If you learn the words on these lists, you’ll improve your reading comprehension
as well as increase your understanding of various disciplines.
How to Use This Book
Don’t try to read this book in a single sitting. You’ll learn much more if you tackle it a
little at a time. You may feel comfortable with a number of the words already. You don’t
need to spend much time on those, but be certain you really do know a word as well as
you think you do before you skip ahead. Some of the most embarrassing vocabulary
blunders occur when we boldly misuse words we feel certain we understand.
The words in Word Smart are arranged alphabetically. You’ll find a Quick Quiz every 10
words or so. You may find it convenient to tackle words in the main list in 10-word
chunks, pausing at each Quick Quiz to make certain you have retained what you just
learned. Don’t forget to check your answers.
If you’re trying to build your vocabulary in preparation for a test, you should set a
schedule for yourself and work methodically from beginning to end. If you’re simply
trying to improve your vocabulary, you may find it more interesting to dip into the text at
random. You can also use the book as a companion to your dictionary to zero in on the
meanings of new words you’ve encountered in reading or in conversation.
When you finish this book, you will have a solid vocabulary that can help you in every
facet of your life—studying in a classroom, communicating at work, even kicking back
with a book on your couch. But don’t stop there. Continue to expand your vocabulary
by mastering the new words you encounter.
Let’s begin!
CHAPTER 1
Learning New Words
Building a Vocabulary Is Child’s Play
Young children learn new words by imitating the speakers around them. When a threeyear-old hears a new word that catches her interest, she may use it repeatedly for a
day or two until she feels comfortable with it. She establishes its meaning from context,
often by trial and error. She adds new words to her vocabulary because she needs
them to make herself understood.
Children have an easier time learning new words than most adults do. As we grow
beyond childhood, our brains seem to lose their magical ability to soak up language
from the environment. But adults can still learn a great deal from the way children learn
new words.
Young children don’t learn the meanings of new words by looking them up. Sometimes
they ask grown-ups directly, but more often they simply infer meanings from context.
They figure out what new words mean by paying attention to how they are used.
You need to do the same. Be receptive to new words by actively seeking to understand
them. When you encounter an unfamiliar word in the newspaper, don’t skim over it.
Stop and try to figure out what it means. The words that surround it should provide a
few clues. Put your mind to work.
A Word Is Useful Only If You Use It
Children learn words by using them. Adults who want to build their vocabularies must
do the same. You can’t incorporate a new word into your vocabulary unless you give it
a thorough workout and then keep it in shape through regular exercise. Use new words
over and over—at the dinner table, at school, in conversation with friends—even at the
risk of making mistakes.
If you are a student preparing to enter college or graduate school, learning new words
can help you perform better on tests like the SAT and GRE, improving your chances of
being admitted to more competitive schools. An added bonus is that your writing and
speaking skills will improve along with your vocabulary, which can help you in your
classes as well. Nonstudents may have other vocabulary needs, but the same general
rules apply. As with many other things, you have to use vocabulary if you don’t want to
lose it. Remember that the size and quality of a person’s vocabulary correlate
powerfully with his or her success in school, at work, and beyond.
Read, Read, Read!
The best way to build a solid, sophisticated vocabulary is to read voraciously. Careful
reading not only brings you into contact with new words but also forces you to use your
brain to figure out what those new words mean. If you read widely enough, you will find
that your vocabulary will build itself. New words are contagious if you give yourself
enough exposure to them. Reading any good book is better for your vocabulary than
watching television. Reading well-written magazines and newspapers can help, too.
Use a Dictionary
When you read, you will undoubtedly come across words you don’t know, and some
will be critical to the meaning of the passages in which they appear. If you’re serious
about understanding what you read, as well as improving your vocabulary, you’ll have
to use the dictionary.
The natural way to learn words is to see how other people use them—that is, to see or
hear the word in context. While context may tell you how to use the word, relying on
context is not without pitfalls.
First, when you hear a new word, you can’t be certain the speaker’s pronunciation is
correct. You also can’t be certain the word is being used correctly. Even skillful writers
and speakers occasionally misuse language. A writer or speaker may even misuse a
word intentionally, perhaps for dramatic or comic effect.
Even more important, many words have multiple meanings and connotations.
Sometimes the difference between one meaning and another is slight; sometimes it is
significant. Even if you deduce the meaning from the context, you have no way of
knowing whether the meaning you’ve deduced will apply in other cases.
Finally, context can be misleading. Take the word formidable, for example. When you
hear this word, you may think of it in the context of “a formidable opponent.” This might
lead you to believe that formidable means something like “skillful” or “aggressive.” But
those definitions miss the mark, as formidable actually means “frightening” or
“menacing.” See how context can be misleading?
The point here is to understand the limits of context and always consult a dictionary if
you’re not sure of the meaning of a word.
Which Dictionary Should You Use?
Like cars, not all dictionaries have the same features. Dictionaries can range from
children’s editions with lots of pictures to humongous, unabridged dictionaries with lots
of entries in tiny type. (By the way, abridged means “shortened.” An unabridged
dictionary is one that includes almost every single word in the English language!) And
then there’s the 20-volume Oxford English Dictionary.
For most people, however, a good college-edition dictionary is sufficient. (A “college”
dictionary is not for use in college only; the phrase “college dictionary” is simply a rough
indication of the vocabulary level of the readers for whom the dictionary is appropriate.)
We encourage you to get in the habit of carrying a portable dictionary with you
wherever you go, so that when you encounter a word you don’t know, you can look it
up on the spot. Of course, we don’t expect you to lug around a huge hardcover
dictionary; try a small paperback copy or even a dictionary app that can be downloaded
to your smartphone or tablet. We recommend using a hard-copy dictionary, as looking
up a word in a real book creates a tactile memory so that you will have a better chance
of remembering the meaning of the word. But ultimately, you should you use the

The main entry—the dot separates the words into syllables. Sometimes the
main entry includes stress marks to tell you which syllables to stress in
pronouncing the word.
The pronunciation—every dictionary includes a pronunciation key up front to
explain symbols like the upside-down e known as a schwa and pronounced
“uh.” If a word has more than one acceptable pronunciation, the entry will list
them.
Always observe the pronunciation of a word when you look it up. If you know
how to pronounce a word, you’re more likely to use it. (If you don’t know how to
pronounce a word, you’re more likely to embarrass yourself at cocktail parties.)
And the more you use a word, the more likely you’ll be able to remember it.
v.t.
Part of speech—this abbreviation means that abridge is a verb, specifically a
transitive verb.
A transitive verb is one that carries action from a subject to a direct object.
For example, in the sentence The dog ate the book, the verb ate carries action
from the dog to the book. Similarly, in The editor abridged the book, the verb
abridged carries action from the editor to the book.
An example of an intransitive verb is to sleep. In The dog sleeps, the verb
does not carry any action from the subject (dog) to any other thing.
a•bridged, a•bridg•ing
Forms—these entries let us know that we should note the spellings of different
forms of the word abridge. Notice, for example, that we drop the e before
adding ing.
1. to shorten by condensation or omission while retaining the basic contents: to
abridge a long novel.
The most common definition of the word. Some dictionaries include helpful
phrases or sentences to show you how to use the word in context.
This feature is quite useful. The example tells us that we would not use
abridge this way: The tailor abridged Susan’s long skirt to make it a mini.
2. to reduce or lessen in duration, scope, etc.; diminish, curtail. 3. to deprive; cut off.
Other definitions, generally in order of importance—sometimes a definition will
include close synonyms.

The etymology—some dictionaries include the etymology before the definitions.
You don’t have to be a linguist, but the word abridge developed from
medieval Latin to Middle French to Middle English: abbreviare (meaning “to
shorten”), in medieval Latin became abreg(i)er in Middle French, which became
abregge or abrigge in Middle English, which finally became abridge.
The etymology suggests that we look up abbreviate. If you have the time, you
should do so. It will reinforce your understanding of abridge.
We will discuss etymology in more detail later because it is a powerful
mnemonic. (Look it up!)
—a•bridg’a•ble; esp. Brit., a•bridge’á•ble, adj. —a•bridg’ér, n.
Other parts of speech, along with an alternative (British) spelling.
—Syn. 1. condense, abstract. See shorten. 2. contract.
An abridged (!) list of synonyms—the numbers refer to the preceding order of
definitions. The entry suggests that we look up shorten. Not all dictionaries
include this feature, though.
Don’t Stop with the Definition
The editors of the dictionary advise us to look up shorten if we want a better
understanding of abridge, so let’s do just that:
short•en (shôr’tən), v.t., 1. to make short or shorter. 2. to reduce, decrease,
take in, etc.: to shorten sail. 3. to make (pastry, bread, etc.) short, as with
butter or other fat. —v.i. 4. to become short or shorter. 5. (of odds) to
decrease. —short’ener, n. —Syn. SHORTEN, ABBREVIATE, ABRIDGE, CURTAIL mean
to make shorter or briefer. SHORTEN is a general word meaning to make less in
extent or duration: to shorten a dress, a prisoner’s sentence. The other three
words suggest methods of shortening. TO ABBREVIATE is to make shorter by
omission or contraction: to abbreviate a word. TO ABRIDGE is to reduce in length
or size by condensing, summarizing, and the like: to abridge a document.
CURTAIL suggests deprivation and lack of completeness because of cutting off
part: to curtail an explanation.
This entry distinguishes shorten from a number of synonyms, including abridge. The
digression took another minute or so, but we’ve come away with a better understanding
of the meanings and their nuances. (Look it up!) We will consider synonyms in detail
when we discuss how to use a thesaurus.
Why Don’t Entries in Word Smart Look Like Standard
Dictionary Entries?
We’ve tried to make Word Smart easier to read and understand than a big dictionary.
Don’t get us wrong. We use dictionaries, we rely on dictionaries, but sometimes we
wish that lexicographers (those fun-loving people who write dictionaries) would
communicate in basic English.
For each word in Word Smart, we give you a basic definition. Sometimes a close
synonym is enough. Then we give you—and this is important—a sentence or two so
that you can see how to use the word. Our entry for abridge reads as follows:
 v to shorten; to condense
• The thoughtful editor abridged the massive book by removing the boring
parts.
An abridged dictionary is one that has been shortened to keep it from crushing
desks and people’s laps.
An abridgment is a shortened or condensed work.
The problem with most dictionaries is that they don’t tell you how to use the word. You
can always spot someone who has learned new words almost exclusively through the
dictionary rather than through general reading supplemented with a dictionary. When
you ask such people the definition of a word, it’s almost as if they fall into a trance—
their eyes glaze over as they rattle off the definition almost word for word from a
dictionary.
So while it’s important to use a dictionary, it’s also important to think critically about the
words as well, because…
You will not truly learn a word unless you can define it in your own
words.
To understand a word completely, to make a word yours, you should try to define it in
your own words. Don’t settle for the dictionary definition. For that matter, don’t settle for
our definition.
Make up your own definition. You’ll understand the meaning better. What’s more, you’ll
be more likely to remember it.
Thesauruses: Don’t Misuse, Abuse, Exploit,
Corrupt, Misapply, or Misemploy Them
A thesaurus is a dictionary-like reference book that lists synonyms for many words. A
thesaurus can be another useful tool in your word-building campaign, but only if you
use it properly. Many people don’t.
Thesaurus abuse is common. Students often try to make their vocabularies seem
bigger than they actually are by using a thesaurus to beef up the papers they write.
(Neophytes chronically endeavor to induce their parlance to portend more magisterially
by employing a lexicon of synonyms to amplify the theses they inscribe.) They write
their papers in their own words, and then they plug in words from a thesaurus. That’s
what we did with the silly-sounding sentence in the parentheses above. You’d be
surprised how many students actually compose their papers that way.
Still, a Thesaurus Can Be Useful
A thesaurus can be helpful—if you use it properly.
The best way to use a thesaurus is as a supplement to your dictionary, as a reference
work that can help you find the word that expresses precisely what you are trying to
say. A good thesaurus is intended to help a speaker or writer distinguish the shades of
difference between words of similar meaning.
How to Use the Thesaurus: An Example
Let’s say you’re trying to describe Randolph, someone who never lends money to
anyone. Randolph examines his monthly bank statement with a calculator to make sure
that his interest has been properly computed to the penny. Randolph is someone who
would have to think long and hard if a mugger presented him with the dilemma “Your
money or your life.”
The first word that comes to mind in describing Randolph may be cheap. Being the
careful writer you are, you decide to see whether cheap is the most precise word you
can come up with.
In your thesaurus, you find the following entry:
cheap adj. 1. Chicken is not as cheap as it was: inexpensive, low-priced,
economical, reasonable. 2. Talk is cheap: effortless, costless, easy. 3. The
coat may be expensive, but it looks cheap: shoddy, shabby, inferior, worthless,
poor, second-rate, trashy, meager, paltry, gimcrack, flashy, gaudy, in bad taste,
tawdry, tacky, common, inelegant. 4. Spreading gossip is a cheap thing to do:
contemptible, petty, despicable, sordid, ignoble, wretched, mean, base. Slang:
two-bit, vulgar, immoral, indecent. 5. He’s too cheap to pick up the check: tight,
The entry cheap lists five primary meanings, each preceded by an illustrative sentence.
You scan the sentences until you find the one you want: the last one. Now you examine
the synonyms.
tight: Okay, but perhaps it’s too informal or colloquial—might be confused with other
definitions of the word tight. Forget this one.
stingy: A possibility.
miserly: Let’s say you’re not exactly sure what this one means. You decide to look
this one up in the regular dictionary.
penurious: Better look this one up, too.
tightfisted: A little better than tight, though perhaps still too slangy—you’ll think about
it.
close: Nope—too many other definitions.
Before leaving the thesaurus, however, you decide to check out the listing for miserly
and come up with the following additional words:
parsimonious: Look it up.
avaricious: Look it up.
mean: Too many other definitions.
grasping: More a synonym of greedy. Randolph isn’t precisely greedy. He doesn’t
want to accumulate a lot; he just wants to hold on to what he has. Forget this one.
scrimping: Doesn’t sound right—forget this one.
pinching: Nope.
penny-pinching: Better than pinching alone, but colloquial—maybe.
frugal: Look it up.
illiberal: Too vague.
closehanded: Nah.
closefisted: Similar to tightfisted and penny-pinching, but not as good—drop.
selfish: Too general—Randolph is selfish only with money.
ungenerous: Nope—Randolph isn’t particularly generous, but you want to say what
he is rather than what he is not.
greedy: You ruled this out earlier.
niggardly: Look it up.
near: Nope.
meager: Look it up.
grudging: Not precisely what you mean.
You decide you have enough synonyms to work with. Now you have to look up and
verify definitions.
You are left with three synonyms you know (stingy, tightfisted, and penny-pinching) and
seven you don’t know. Just to be orderly, you look up the seven words alphabetically in
your dictionary:
avaricious characterized by avarice (insatiable greed for riches; inordinate desire to
gain and hoard wealth); covetous
Nope, you don’t mean greedy. Avaricious is out.
frugal 1. economical in use or expenditure; prudently saving or sparing. 2. entailing
little expense; requiring few resources; meager, scanty.
The first definition means careful with money. Economical and prudent both have
positive connotations, but Randolph’s obsession with money is not something good.
The second definition is not the one we want—out.
meager 1. deficient in quantity or quality; lacking fullness or richness; poor; scanty.
2. having little flesh; lean; thin. 3. maigre.
Nope, none of these seems to convey the meaning you want.
miserly of, like, or befitting a miser (one who lives in wretched circumstances in
order to save and hoard money); penurious; niggardly.
Well, this might be right. You have to think about Randolph a little more. What are his
circumstances like? Is he willing to live in wretched circumstances?
niggardly reluctant to give or spend; stingy. —Syn. 1. penurious, miserly.
It’s a possiblity. Let’s take a look at the last few before you decide.
parsimonious characterized by or showing parsimony; sparing or frugal, esp. to
excess.
Now you have established that parsimonious means stingier than frugal. This seems to
hit the mark.
penurious 1. extremely stingy. 2. extremely poor; indigent. 3. poorly or inadequately
supplied.
The first definition works, but the second definition seems to imply a stinginess perhaps
resulting from poverty. The third definition does not apply. Now you have to think again
about Randolph. Is he poor as well as cheap? If so, this is the right word.
You’re still left with stingy, tightfisted, penny-pinching, miserly, niggardly, parsimonious,
and penurious. Oh, and there’s still the blunt, if unassuming, cheap, which you started
with. Which word is the right word?
Stingy is the right word if you want to use a simple, no-nonsense word.
Tightfisted is the word if you want something a little more slangy and graphic.
Penny-pinching is right if you want the image to be a little more explicit than tightfisted.
Miserly could be the right word, depending on Randolph’s living circumstances.
Niggardly is the right word if Randolph is merely reluctant to spend money. If he’s more
than reluctant, this isn’t the right word.
Parsimonious is the right word if you want a multisyllabic synonym for cheap or stingy.
From the definitions, parsimonious seems more extreme than stingy.
Penurious is the right word if Randolph is poor as well as stingy.
To decide which word is the right word, you must give more thought to precisely what
aspect of Randolph you’re trying to capture and convey.
The right word is not merely the accurate word with the proper
connotations.
We don’t want to get into writing style, but other considerations to keep in mind when
choosing the right word include the following:
Rhythm, or Cadence
Which word best fits in with the overall flow of the sentence and paragraph? Perhaps
you want to achieve alliteration (Randolph is a pretentious, penny-pinching poet) or a
certain rhyme (Alimony drove Randolph to parsimony).
Part of Speech
Miserly seems okay as an adjective, but miserliness seems a little awkward as a noun.
Vocabulary Level
Who will read your description of Randolph? Your word choice may be limited by your
potential reader or audience. Other things being equal, the simple word is the better
word.
Variety
If you’ve used cheap several times already in the same piece of writing, you may want
to use a different word.
Repetition
On the other hand, repeating the same word may have a powerful effect.
Dramatic Effect
A simple word in an academic setting, or an academic word in a simple setting, can
have a dramatic effect. Comic effects can also be achieved by using a word in an
inappropriate or incongruous context.
Editing Is More Than Choosing the Right Word
Word Smart is a book on words rather than on writing. Still, we want to note in passing
that good editing is more than simply reviewing the words you use.
Editing means refining your ideas. Editing means deciding on the ordering and
presentation of your ideas. Editing means deciding which ideas you’re going to present
at all.
Which Thesaurus Should I Use?
We recommend that the thesaurus you use be one that lists words alphabetically in the
text itself. Ideally, the thesaurus should include sample sentences that distinguish at
least some of the different shades of meanings.
Reading This Book
Reading widely—with the help of a dictionary and perhaps also a thesaurus—is a great
way to build a vocabulary. But it’s also a slow way. Which words you encounter in your
reading depend on which words the writers happen to use.
That’s where we come in. The main section of Word Smart is a concentrated source of
the words you want to know—the words you need to help yourself build an educated
vocabulary. We’ve also included fun facts, etymology, and usage, which are integral to
the vocabulary learning methods you’re about to encounter. If you want a better
vocabulary, you have to put the time and effort in.
As you work through this book, you’ll undoubtedly find that you need to tailor your
approach to the way you think and learn best. You may discover that for a particular
word one method works best and that for another word a different method works best.
That’s fine.
The best method for memorizing words is the method that works best
for you.
We’ll show you the methods we have found to be the most successful for our students.
Use the one or ones that suit you best.
Basic Method #1: Tricks and Mnemonics
A mnemonic is a device or trick that helps you remember something specific. Grade
schoolers are sometimes taught to remember the spelling of arithmetic by using the
following mnemonic: A Rat In The House Might Eat Tom’s Ice Cream. The first letter in
each word in this silly sentence stands for the letters in arithmetic. Remember the
sentence and you remember how to spell the word.
Mnemonics can appeal to our ears, too. How about the history mnemonic: In fourteen
hundred ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue…? Or the spelling mnemonic: i
before e except after c, and in words that say a, as in neighbor and weigh?
You Already Know How to Use Mnemonics
Whether you realize it or not, you use mnemonics all the time. When you make up a
little game to remember your locker combination or a friend’s birthday, you’re using a
mnemonic.
How Do Mnemonics Work?
All mnemonics work in the same way: they force you to associate what you’re trying to
remember with something that you already know, or with something that is easier to
memorize. Patterns and rhymes are easy to memorize, which explains why so many
mnemonics use them.
Incidentally, it may also explain why rhyming became a part of poetry. The earliest
poets and balladeers didn’t write down their compositions because many didn’t know
how to write. Instead, they kept the poems in their heads. Among other things, the
rhymes at the ends of the lines made the poems easier to remember.
Basic Method #2: Seeing Is Remembering
Letting a new word suggest a vivid mental image to you is a powerful and effective way
to remember that word. Mental images are really mnemonics, too. They help you
remember. The emphasis here is on suggestive mental pictures rather than on tricky
abbreviations or coincidences of spelling.
Let’s look at an example. We’ll start with a word we’ve already used in this chapter:
abridge. As you know, to abridge is to shorten or condense.
What image pops into your mind when you think of the word abridge? That’s easy: a
bridge. Now you need to picture something happening on or to that bridge that will help
you remember the meaning of the word abridge. Your goal is to create such a vivid and
memorable image in your mind that the next time you encounter abridge in your
reading, you’ll instantly remember what it means.
To be useful, your image must have something to do with the meaning of the word
rather than merely with the way it sounds or looks. If you merely think of a bridge when
you see abridge, you won’t help yourself remember what you want to remember.
What you need is an image that suggests shortening or condensing. A dinosaur taking
a big bite out of the middle of a bridge? Carpenters sawing it? The image you choose is
up to you.
And Now for Another Example…
Another useful word is gregarious, which means sociable, enjoying the company of
others. What image springs to mind? Really think now.
Can’t think of an image? Be creative. A party animal is gregarious. How about
imagining a party animal named
 Arious. Don’t stop with his name. You need a
picture. So give  a funny hat, a noisemaker, and some polka-dot dancing shoes.
Or put a lampshade on his head. Think of something that will make you think of
sociability the next time you see Greg’s name in a book or a magazine you read. The
more real you make   seem in your imagination, the less trouble you’ll have
remembering the meaning of gregarious.
The Crazier the Mental Image, the Better
It’s better to choose an interesting mental image that you’ll remember. If you choose an
image that is bland or boring, you may have trouble remembering the word. Interesting,
even weird, mental images are more likely to stick in your memory.
Memory Aids Should Be Personal
Sometimes we’ll give you a mnemonic for the listings in Word Smart, but we won’t do
this very often. Memory aids work best when you have to struggle a little to come up
with them.
If you come up with your own memory aid, if it really means something to you, it will
likely become a permanent part of your memory.
Basic Method #3: Etymological Clues
Although the English language contains hundreds of thousands of words, you will
discover that many groups of words are related in meaning because they developed
from a common root. When you recognize that a group of words shares a similar root,
you will more easily remember the entire group.
For example, take the word mnemonic. You know now, if you hadn’t already, that a
mnemonic is a device that helps you remember something. We’re going to show you
two other words that are related to this word.
mnemonic: device to help you remember something
amnesty: a general pardon for offenses against a government (an official
“forgetting”)
amnesia: loss of memory
Pretty neat, eh? How about words from another common root:
chronological: in order according to time
synchronize: to put on the same timetable
anachronism: something out of place in time or history
chronic: continuing over a long time
chronicle: chronological record of events
chronometer: device to measure time
Sometimes it is easier to learn a whole cluster of related words than to come up with
mnemonics for them individually.
The Advantages of Etymology
Learning word roots is a key part of etymology, the study of the origin of words and how
their meanings have changed over time. A word’s etymology tells you something about
the meaning of the word. Additionally, etymology can be shared among several words,
which can help you remember the meanings of clusters of related words. Learning
etymology can also get you interested in the origin of words and language in general;
etymology tells you the story of a word over centuries. In Chapter 6 you will find a list of
the most important roots with numerous examples following each.
The Pitfalls of Etymology
The etymology of a word will tell you something about the word, but it will rarely give
you the full definition. Students often confuse a word’s etymology with its meaning,
which can lead to errors on tests.
Take the word verdant, for example. At first glance, you may think this word is
etymologically related to words like verify, verdict, verisimilitude, and veritable and
guess that the definition of verdant must have something to do with the concept of truth
or reality.
This is clever guesswork, but verdant actually comes from a different family of words. It
comes from the same old root as does the French word vert, which means green. If
those same clever students had recognized that connection, they might have realized
that verdant means green with vegetation, as in a verdant forest.
Similarly, a lot of words that begin with ped- have something to do with foot: pedestrian,
pedal, pedestal, pedometer, impede, expedite. A pediatrician, however, is not a foot
doctor. A pediatrician is a doctor for children. A podiatrist is a foot doctor. (The word
pediatrician is, however, related to the word meaning a strict teacher of children:
pedagogue.)
Etymology is a powerful tool to remember words that you already
know, but it can’t always be relied upon to determine the meanings of
words you don’t know.
Basic Method #4: Writing on Your Brain
Many people find that they can learn new information more readily if they write it down.
The physical act of writing seems to plant the information more firmly. Perhaps the
explanation is that by writing you are bringing another sense into play (you’ve seen the
word, you’ve said and heard the word, and now you’re feeling the word).
You may find it useful to spend some time writing down phrases or sentences
incorporating each new word. This is a good way to practice and strengthen your
spelling as well.
You’ll probably have more luck if you don’t merely write down the word and its definition
over and over again. If you’ve hit upon a good mnemonic or mental image to help you
remember it, or you liked the etymology, write it down. You can even draw a picture or
a diagram.
Basic Method #5: Putting It All Together with Flashcards
and a Notebook
A flashcard, usually made with an index card, contains a word on one side and its
definition on the reverse side. You may have used flashcards when you were first
learning to read or when you were first tackling a foreign language. Flashcards can turn
learning into a game and is an effective way to study and commit words to memory.
Along with the word’s definition, you should also include the pronunciation if you aren’t
sure you’ll remember it. Then you can either practice independently or have a friend
quiz you.
Here’s a basic flashcard, front and back.
Front
Back
You’ll learn even more if you use your imagination to make the backs of your flashcards
a bit more elaborate. For example, you might decorate the back of this card with a
diagram of oblique lines—that is, lines that are neither parallel nor perpendicular to
each other.
Back
Your diagram now gives you a mental image that can help you remember the word.
You’ll probably think of your own mental image, one that means something to you. You
could even use the word itself to create a picture that conveys the meaning of the word
and that will stick in your mind to help you remember it.
Here’s one possibility. We’ve divided the word into two parts and written them on two
different lines that are at an oblique angle to each other.
Back
Practicing with flashcards can be fun. Parents, siblings, and friends sometimes might
lend a hand and discover that they learn new words, too. And every time you look at
the back of the card, you’ll be reminded of the mnemonic, trick, or mental image you’ve
devised to keep the word firmly in your memory.
Tuck a few flashcards in your pocket when you head out the door in the morning, and
work on them in spare moments, like when you’re riding on a bus or listening to the
radio. The more often you flash through your flashcards, the faster you’ll build your
vocabulary.
Reading your flashcards isn’t enough, of course. You also need to
make an effort to use the words on them. Using the words, much
more than reading the cards, makes the definitions sink in and take
hold.
We also encourage you to write down new words you learn in a notebook. If you
devote an entire page to each new word, the notebook will give you room to practice
“writing on your brain.” It will also give you plenty of space to doodle or jot down images
that will help you remember the word.
Even better, you can use your notebook as a place to record actual uses of new words
that you discover in your own reading. If, while reading a magazine, you come across
one of the words you’re working on, you can copy the sentence into your notebook,
giving you a brand-new example of the word in context.
Students who keep notebooks report a sense of accomplishment when they look back
through their notebooks at the hundreds of new words they have learned. A notebook
gives you tangible (a good word) evidence of the progress you’re making.
A Memorization Game Plan
Here is our step-by-step approach to memorizing new words.
Step 1 Try to deduce the word’s meaning from context.
Step 2 Look it up!
Step 3 Note the spelling.
Step 4 Say the word out loud.
Step 5 Read the main definition. Scan the secondary definitions.
Step 6 Compare the definition with the definitions and usages of the
word’s synonyms.
Step 7 Define the word using your own words.
Step 8 Use it in a sentence.
Step 9 Attach the word to a mnemonic, mental image, or other memory
aid.
Step 10 Fill out a flashcard and make a new entry in your notebook.
Step 11 Use the new word every chance you get.
Let’s take a look at each of these steps.
Step 1: Try to Deduce the Word’s Meaning From Context
Context will often lead you astray, but doing a bit of detective work is a good way to
sharpen your mind and hone your reading comprehension skills. And who knows? You
might even guess the right meaning.
Step 2: Look It Up!
Most people try to skip this step. Don’t you dare! You won’t know whether you’re
correct about the meaning of a new word until you’ve made sure by looking it up.
No one can learn new words without a dictionary. If you don’t have one, get one now,
whether a physical copy from your local bookstore or library or a downloadable app on
your smartphone or tablet.
Step 3: Note the Spelling
Look closely at the word’s spelling. Then close your eyes and try to reconstruct the
spelling. If you have trouble visualizing, test yourself by writing out the spelling on scrap
paper and checking it against the dictionary.
You should also compare the spelling variations with other spelling variations you
know. This is a nice trick that helps you recognize words that you think you don’t know.
For example, sober is an adjective; the noun form is sobriety. Okay, with that as a clue,
the noun propriety relates to what adjective? Proper. Propriety means what is socially
proper or acceptable.
Here’s another example: Do you know what incisive means? Give up? Well, you know
what decisive means, don’t you? Decisive relates to what word you know? Decision, of
course. Now, what noun do you think incisive relates to? Incision. Incisive means sharp
or cutting, as in an incisive remark or an incisive observation.
Step 4: Say the Word Out Loud
Say the word out loud. Hearing the word will bring another sense into play and help you
remember the word. And as we noted earlier, you don’t want to make a fool of yourself
by mispronouncing words.
Our Pronunciation Key
We’ve never liked the pronunciation keys most dictionaries use. Our key is based on
consistent phonetic sounds, so you don’t have to memorize it. Still, it would be a good
idea to take a few minutes now and familiarize yourself with the table below. Be sure to
note how the e and i are used.
The letter(s) is (are) pronounced like
the letter(s)
in the word(s)
a a bat, can
ah o con, bond
aw aw paw, straw
ay a skate, rake
e e stem, hem
ee ea steam, clean
i i rim, chin, hint
ing ing sing, ring
oh o row, tow
oo oo room, boom
ow ow cow, brow
oy oy boy, toy
u, uh u run, bun
y (ye, eye) i climb, time
ch ch chair, chin
f f, ph film, phony
g g go, goon
j j join, jungle
k c cool, cat
s s solid, wisp
sh sh shoe, wish
z z zoo, razor
zh s measure
uh a apologize
All other consonants are pronounced as you would expect. Capitalized letters are
accented.
Step 5: Read the Main Definition; Scan the Secondary
Definitions
Most dictionaries list the definitions in order of importance. That does not mean, of
course, that the first definition is the one you are looking for. Read all the definitions;
each will add to your understanding of the word.
Step 6: Compare the Definition with the Definitions and
Usages of the Word’s Synonyms
As we showed you with the earlier examples, this step takes a little extra time. Believe
us when we say that it is time well spent. Again, seeing how a word is similar to or
different from synonyms or related words enhances your understanding of all of them.
Step 7: Define the Word Using Your Own Words
We said it before, and we’ll say it again: you don’t truly know what a word means
unless you can define it yourself in your own way.
Step 8: Use It in a Sentence
Now that you know what the word means and what it doesn’t mean, use it. Make up a
sentence.
It helps to use the word in a sentence that includes a person or thing or event that you
know and that creates a concrete feeling or image. For example, the sentence They
are gregarious is not as good as Greg, Gertrude, and Gretchen are gregarious.
Step 9: Attach the Word to a Mnemonic, Mental Image, or
Other Memory Aid
With all that you’ve done with the word in the previous steps, you may already have
memorized it. The only way to be sure, however, is to fix the word with a mnemonic.
Step 10: Fill Out A Flashcard and Make a New Entry in
Your Notebook
The paperwork is very important, particularly if you’re trying to learn a lot of new words
in a short period of time.
Step 11: Use the New Word Every Chance You Get
Dare to be repetitious. If you don’t keep new knowledge in shape, you won’t keep it at
all.
Two Final Words of Advice: Be Suspicious
You already know some of the words in the book. You may know quite a few of them.
Naturally, you don’t need to drill yourself on words you already know and use. But be
careful. Before skipping a word, make certain you really do know what it means. Some
of the most embarrassing vocabulary mistakes occur when a person confidently uses
familiar words incorrectly. Now on to the words. Remember that you’ll retain more (and
have more fun) if you tackle this book a little at a time.

CHAPTER 4
SAT Key Terms
Need-to-Know Words for the SAT
Although the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section of the SAT emphasizes
critical reading and writing skills, many questions nevertheless test your vocabulary
knowledge, such as vocabulary-in-context questions. Other questions are related to
vocabulary in a more peripheral way; the reading passages, grammar sections
(especially those involving diction), and even the essay will be more easily dealt with if
you have an erudite vocabulary. If you learn every word on the main word list in this
book, you’ll have a big advantage on the SAT. The bigger your vocabulary, the better
you’ll do. But not every word on the main list is the sort of word that is tested on the
SAT. If you’re getting ready to take the SAT or a similar standardized test, you should
focus your attention on the words in the following list.
We’ve included short definitions to make it easier for you to learn the words. These
definitions aren’t always exactly like the ones you’ll find in the dictionary or the main
word list of this book; the y’re the definitions of the words as they are tested on the
SAT.
Keep in mind that these are not the only words you need to know for the SAT. They’re
just the words that have been tested most frequently in the past—the words that the
test writers tend to come back to over and over again
Some SATs are absolutely loaded words on this list; others don’t contain as many. One
of the most important things these key terms will teach you is the level of the
vocabulary on the test. Once you get a feel for this level, you’ll be able to spot other
possible so-called SAT words in your reading.
After you review these key terms, you should also turn to the GRE list starting on this
page. Of course, all of the words in this book are ones that will help you on
standardized tests.

CHAPTER 6
Word Roots You Should Know
You Don’t Have to Memorize These Roots—You
Already Know Them!
Here is a list of the most helpful roots to know. As mentioned earlier, learning roots
helps you memorize words. We’ve focused on roots that will help you learn the Word
Smart words, but this list will help you memorize hundreds of other words, too.
When you look up the definition of a word on this list, try to relate that definition to the
root. Some students go through this list one root at a time. They look up all the words
under one root and learn the definitions together. As always, whatever works for you is
best.
To show you how each root relates to words you already know, each list includes an
easy word or two. For example, the root spec- comes from a Latin word meaning to
look or see, as in the easy words spectator and spectacles. Recognizing that will help
you memorize the definition of the less common words specter and circumspect, which
are on the same list. And you thought you didn’t know Latin!
You will notice that the same root can be spelled in different ways.
We have included the most common spelling variations in the
heading. Remember that roots tell us the common heritage of words
thousands of years old. Over the centuries spelling variations are
bound to occur.
A note to philologists (etymologically, “word lovers”): In keeping with our pragmatic
philosophy, we have sometimes taken liberties in compiling this list.

CHAPTER 7
Common Usage Errors
Some of the most embarrassing language errors involve words so common and so
apparently simple that almost no one would think of looking them up. The following list
contains a number of the most frequently misused words and expressions in the
language.
ALL RIGHT Not “alright.”
AMONG/BETWEEN Among is used with three or more people or things; between is
used with two.
• The tin-can telephone line ran between the two houses.
• Among the twelve members of the committee were only three women.
• Mr. Nuñez distributed the candy among the four of us.
Between you and I is incorrect; between you and me is correct.
ANXIOUS This word properly means “filled with anxiety,” not “eager.” Don’t say you’re
anxious for school to end unless the ending of school makes you feel fearful.
AS FAR AS…IS CONCERNED Not a stylish expression, but if you use it, don’t leave
out the is concerned. It is not correct to say, “As far as money, I’d like to be rich.”
Instead, you should say, “As far as money is concerned, I’d like to be rich.”
AS/LIKE You can run like a fox, but you can’t run like a fox runs.
Like is used only with nouns, pronouns, and grammatical constructions that act like
nouns.
• Joe runs like a fox.
• Joe runs as a fox runs.
• Joe runs the way a fox runs.
BIWEEKLY, BIMONTHLY. Biweekly means either twice a week or once every two
weeks, depending on who is using it. Likewise with bimonthly. If you need to be
precise, avoid these words by saying “twice a week” or “every other week” instead.
Fortnightly means once every two weeks.
CAN/MAY Can denotes ability; may denotes permission. If you can do something, you
are able to do it. If you may do something, you are permitted to do it.
CAPITAL/CAPITOL Washington, D.C., is the capital of the United States. The building
where Congress meets is the Capitol.
COMMON/MUTUAL Common means “shared”; mutual means “reciprocal.” If Tim and
Tom have a common dislike, they both dislike the same thing (anchovies). If Tim and
Tom have a mutual dislike, they dislike each other.
COMMONPLACE In careful usage, this word is an adjective meaning “ordinary” or
“uninteresting.” It can also be used as a noun meaning a “trite or obvious observation”
or a “cliché.” It should not be used sloppily as a substitute for the word “common.”
• To say that French food is the best in the world is a commonplace.
• It is commonplace but neither interesting nor perceptive to say that French food is
the best in the world.
COMPARE TO/COMPARE WITH To compare an apple to an orange is to say that an
apple is like an orange. To compare an apple with an orange is to discuss the
similarities and differences between the two fruits.
• Daisuke compared his girlfriend’s voice to the sound of a cat howling in the night;
that is, he said his girlfriend sounded like a cat howling in the night.
• I compared my grades with Beth’s and discovered that she had done better in every
subject except math.
DIFFERENT FROM Different from is correct; “different than” is not.
• My dog is different from your dog.
EACH OTHER/ONE ANOTHER Each other is used with two; one another is used with
three or more.
• A husband and wife should love each other.
• The fifteen members of the group had to learn to get along with one another.
EQUALLY AS Nothing is ever “equally as” anything as anything else.
• Your car and Dave’s car might be equally fast.
You should never say that the two cars are equally as fast. Nor should you say that
your car is equally as fast as Dave’s. You should simply say that it is as fast.
(THE) FACT THAT/THAT You almost never need to use “the fact that”; that alone will
suffice.
Instead of saying, “I was appalled by the fact that he was going to the movies,” say, “I
was appalled that he was going to the movies.”
FARTHER/FURTHER Farther refers to actual, literal distance—the kind measured in
inches and miles. Further refers to figurative distance. Use farther if the distance can
be measured; use further if it cannot.
• Paris is farther from - than London is.
• Paris is further from my thoughts than London is.
• We hiked seven miles but then were incapable of hiking farther.
• I made a nice outline for my thesis but never went any further.
FEWER, LESS Fewer is used with things that can be counted, less with things that
cannot. That is, fewer refers to number; less refers to quantity.
• I have fewer sugar lumps than Henry does.
• I have less sugar.
Despite what you hear on television, it is not correct to say that one soft drink contains
“less calories” than another. It contains fewer calories (calories can be counted); it is
less fattening.
FORMER, LATTER Former means the first of two people or things; latter means the
second of two. If you are referring to three or more things, you shouldn’t use former
and latter.
It is incorrect to say, “The restaurant had hamburgers, hot dogs, and pizzas; we
ordered the former.” Instead, say, “We ordered the first,” or, “We ordered hamburgers.”
IF/WHETHER Almost everyone uses if in situations that call for whether. If should be
used when something may or may not happen and is usually followed by then.
Whether should be used when more than one alternative is being discussed. For
example: “We need to decide whether we should go to the show or stay home.” The
use of if in this situation is widely accepted, but the use of if in some situations might
cause confusion. Consider this sentence: “Let me know if you’re coming tonight.”
Someone might interpret this to mean “If you’re coming tonight, then let me know. If
you’re not coming tonight, then you don’t have to reply.” To make it clear that you
expect a response, use whether: “Let me know whether you’re coming tonight.” This
should be interpreted as “No matter what you decide, please let me know your plans.”
IRREGARDLESS This is not a word. Say regardless or irrespective.
LAY/LIE The only way to “lay down on the beach” is to take small feathers and place
them in the sand.
To lay is to place or set.
• Will the widow lay flowers by the grave? She already laid them, or she has already
laid them. Who lies in the grave? Her former husband lies there. He lay there
yesterday, too. In fact, he has lain there for several days.
PLURALS AND SINGULARS
The following words take plural verbs:
both
criteria
media
phenomena
The following words take singular verbs:
criterion
each
either
every, everybody, everyone, everything
medium
neither
none, no one, nobody, nothing
phenomenon
PRESENTLY Presently means “soon,” not “now” or “currently.”
• The mailman should be here presently; in fact, he should be here in about five
minutes.
• The mailman is here now.
STATIONARY/STATIONERY Stationary means not moving; stationery is notepaper.
THAT/WHICH Most people confuse these two words. Many people who know the
difference have trouble remembering it. Here’s a simple rule that will almost always
work: that can never have a comma in front of it; which always will.
• There is the car that ran over my foot.
• Ed’s car, which ran over my foot, is over there.
• I like sandwiches that are dripping with mustard.
• My sandwich, which was dripping with mustard, was the kind I like.
Which is used in place of that if it follows another that: “We were fond of that feeling of
contentment which follows victory.”

CHAPTER 9
The Arts
You don’t need to be a master of music, literature, film, or another artistic discipline to
keep up in a conversation or course about the arts. Here are some major key art terms
to keep in your back pocket.
ALLITERATION A poetic device involving the use of two or more words with the same
initial consonant sounds. Big Bird is an alliterative name.
BAUHAUS A German school of art and architecture founded in 1919. Bauhaus style is
characterized by harsh geometric form and great austerity of detail.
BIOPIC A biographical film. Gandhi and Malcolm X are well-known biopics. Some,
such as The Hours (about Virginia Woolf) and Capote (about Truman Capote and
Harper Lee), interweave real and fictitious plots or use a single incident to shed light on
a person’s entire life.
BLANK VERSE Unrhymed verse, especially in iambic pentameter.
CHAMBER MUSIC Music written for and performed by small ensembles of players.
The string quartet (two violins, viola, and cello) is the most influential form of chamber
music ensemble.
CHIAROSCURO An artistic technique in which form is conveyed by light and dark only,
not by color.
CONCERTO A musical composition for an orchestra and one or more soloists.
CUBISM An early 20th century artistic movement involving, among other things, the
fragmented portrayal of three-dimensional objects. Cubism was given its highest
expression by Pablo Picasso.
DOCUMENTARY A nonfiction film intended to record or capture (and often comment
on) some part of reality. Hoop Dreams, March of the Penguins, and Fahrenheit 9/11 are
examples of well-known documentaries.
FREE VERSE Unrhymed and unmetered (or irregularly rhymed and metered) verse.
FRESCO An artistic technique in which paint is applied to wet plaster, causing the
painted image to become bound into the decorated surface.
HAIKU A three-line, non-rhyming poem in which the first and third lines contain five
syllables, and the second contains seven. Traditional Japanese haiku (plural and
singular forms are identical) often evoke the seasons.
IAMBIC PENTAMETER A poetic metrical form in which each line of verse consists of
ten syllables, of which only the even-numbered syllables are stressed.
IMPRESSIONISM A late 19th century French movement in painting that attempted,
among other things, to convey the effect of light more vividly than had previously been
done. Claude Monet was among the most influential of the Impressionists.
JAZZ An influential American music style rooted in African and African-American
traditions with input from diverse sources. Jazz has many spin-offs and subgenres.
Famous jazz musicians have included Duke Ellington and Charlie Parker.
LIBERAL ARTS A general course of study focusing on literature, art, history,
philosophy, and related subjects rather than on specifically vocational instruction.
METAPHOR A figure of speech involving the use of words associated with one thing in
connection with another in order to point up some revealing similarity between the two.
To refer to someone’s nose as his or her beak is to use metaphor to say something
unflattering about the person’s nose.
MOSAIC An art form in which designs are produced by inlaying small tiles or pieces of
stone, glass, or other materials.
NARRATIVE FILM A fiction film told primarily in chronological order. Most popular films
fall into this category.
NOIR A film and literature style portraying crime and sleaze in an atmosphere of
mystery, bleakness, cynicism, and/or glamour. Noir (pronounced “nwar”) often contains
a political subtext of corruption or paranoia. Well-known examples include The Big
Sleep and Chinatown.
OPERA A drama set to music, in which the dialogue is sung rather than spoken.
OVERTURE An introductory musical piece for an opera or other work of musical
drama.
POSTCOLONIALISM A literary and philosophical movement concerned with life and
identity in formerly colonized cultures. Well-known postcolonial writers include Franz
Fanon, Jamaica Kincaid, and Salman Rushdie.
RENAISSANCE The blossoming of art, literature, science, and culture in general that
transformed Europe between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries.
ROMAN À CLEF A novel in which the characters and events are disguised versions of
real people and events.
ROMANTICISM An anticlassical literary and artistic movement that began in Europe in
the late 18th century. William Wordsworth and-Keats were perhaps the
preeminent Romantic poets.
SIMILE A figure of speech in which one thing is likened to something else. A simile will
always contain the word like or as. To call someone’s nose a beak is to use a
metaphor; to say that someone’s nose is like a beak is to use a simile.
SONATA An instrumental musical composition consisting of several movements.
SONNET A verse form consisting of fourteen lines of iambic pentameter rhymed in a
strict scheme.
STILL LIFE An artistic depiction of arranged objects.
STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS A literary technique in which an author attempts to

SYMPHONY A major work for orchestra, usually consisting of several movements.
CHAPTER 10
Finance
Reading the financial pages of the newspaper can be confusing if you don’t know the
lingo. Here are some of the terms that crop up most often.
ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) A loan’s annual percentage rate is the loan’s
true interest rate when all the costs of borrowing are taken into account. Before lending
you $10,000 at a nominal interest rate of 12 percent, a bank may charge you a fee of
several hundred dollars. The effective interest rate on the loan—its APR—would
include the cost of paying this fee and would thus be somewhat higher than 12 percent.
ASSET An asset is something you own. A liability is something you owe.
BANKRUPTCY A procedure by which a deeply indebted person or company sacrifices
most or all remaining assets in exchange for being relieved of the obligation to repay
any remaining debts.
BEAR MARKET A falling stock market.
BONDS When you buy a bond you are, in effect, lending money to the city, company,
or other entity that issued it. In return, the issuer pays you interest.
There are many different kinds of bonds. U.S. government bonds are bonds issued by
the federal government. When you buy a government bond, you’re helping to finance
the federal deficit. Municipal bonds are bonds issued by cities, counties, and states.
They are often issued to finance specific projects, such as the construction of a
highway or an athletic stadium. Corporate bonds are bonds issued by companies. Junk
bonds are high-interest, high-risk bonds issued by relatively uncredit-worthy borrowers.
BOOK VALUE A company’s book value is what the company would be worth if its
assets (including office buildings and furniture) were all sold and its liabilities were all
paid off.
BULL MARKET A rising stock market.
CALL An option to buy stock at a certain price within a certain period of time. A put is
an option to sell stock at a certain price within a certain period of time. Puts and calls
are not for amateurs.
CAPITAL GAIN The profit on the sale of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other so-called
capital assets. If you buy a stock for $5 a share and sell it a few weeks later for $1,000
a share, you have a capital gain of $995 a share. A capital loss is the same thing in
reverse.
COMMODITIES Pork bellies, beef fat, wheat, corn, gold, silver, and other animal,
vegetable, and mineral products are a few examples of commodities. Contracts for
these items are traded in highly risky markets that are no place for someone who can’t
afford to lose a lot of money.
COMMON STOCKS A share of common stock represents a (usually tiny) piece of the
company that issues it. If you own a share of stock in a company, you own a fraction of
the company itself and are entitled to a corresponding fraction of the company’s profits,
usually paid in the form of quarterly dividends.
COMPOUND INTEREST Compound interest is interest paid on interest that’s already
been paid. If you put $100 in a savings account and don’t withdraw the interest
payments, the effective interest rate on your initial investment rises as each new
interest payment increases the value of your account. The compounding of interest
causes an account earning 10 percent interest to double in value in about seven years
instead of the ten you might expect.
CORPORATE BONDS See bonds.
DISCOUNT BROKERAGE A stockbrokerage that charges lower commissions than
traditional stockbrokerages but provides fewer services.
DIVIDEND When a company earns profits, it typically reinvests some in itself and
distributes the rest to its shareholders, who are the company’s owners. These profit
distributions are typically paid quarterly and are called dividends.
DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE An index based on the stock prices of thirty big
industrial companies. The Dow Jones isn’t a representative sample of either the stock
market or the economy in general, but it has traditionally been used as a barometer of
both.
EQUITY Equity is the difference between assets and liabilities. If your house (an asset)
is worth $100,000 and you owe $45,000 on it (a liability), your equity in your house is
$55,000.
A home equity loan is a loan backed by your equity in your home. Home equity loans
used to be called second mortgages. If you stop paying off your home equity loan, you
risk losing your house.
FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION The FDIC is the government
agency that insures bank deposits.
HOME EQUITY LOAN See equity.
MARGIN Buying stock on margin is buying stock in part with money borrowed from the
stockbroker. Buying on margin is risky. If the price of a stock you bought on margin falls
below a certain point, the broker will require you to put up more money. If you don’t
have the money, you may be forced to sell the stock immediately at a loss in order to
cover your position.
MORTGAGE When you obtain a mortgage to buy a house, what you are really doing is
persuading a bank to buy a house for you and let you live in it in exchange for your
promise to pay back the bank, with interest, over a period of years. If you stop paying
back the bank, the bank may take back the house. In other words, the bank lends you
enough money to buy the house with the understanding that the bank gets the house if
you don’t pay back the loan. A traditional mortgage runs for thirty years at a fixed
interest rate with fixed monthly payments, but there are many variations.
MUTUAL FUND A mutual fund is an investment pool in which a large number of
investors put their money together in the hope of making more money than they would
have if they had invested on their own. Mutual funds are run by professional managers
who may or may not be better than the average person at picking good investments.
Some mutual funds invest only in stocks; some invest only in bonds; some invest only
in metals; some invest only in Japanese stocks; some invest in a little of everything;
some invest in whatever looks good at the moment.
ODD LOT Less than 100 shares of a company’s stock. Groups of shares in multiples of
100 are known as round lots. Brokerages typically charge slightly higher commissions
on transactions involving odd lots.
OPTION The opportunity to do something else (such as buy a certain number of
shares at a certain price) at some time in the future.
OVER-THE-COUNTER STOCK An OTC stock is one that isn’t traded on the -
Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ; one of several smaller stock exchanges. A stock
exchange is a big marketplace where buyers and sellers (or, usually, their
representatives) gather to do business within a framework of mutually agreed-upon
rules and limitations. But not all stocks are bought and sold through stock exchanges.
These stocks (typically those of smaller, less-established companies) are said to be
bought and sold “over the counter.” To buy or sell such a stock, you have to do
business directly with someone who deals in it, or “makes a market” in it. Most
stockbrokers of any size have over-the-counter departments that handle such
transactions.
PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO A stock’s P/E is the ratio of its price and the value of the
company’s earnings in the past year divided by the number of shares outstanding. If a
stock sells for $20 a share and had earnings of $2 a share, its P/E is 10, and its share
price is said to be “ten times earnings.” In theory, if everything else is equal, a stock
with a high P/E is a worse buy than a stock with a low P/E, but there are many
exceptions.
PRIME RATE The interest rate that banks charge their biggest and best loan
customers. Everybody else pays more. Many loan rates are keyed to the prime, which
is why a change in the prime rate affects more than just the biggest and best loan
customers.
PROXY Ownership of a share of stock entitles the shareholder to vote at the
company’s annual meeting. Shareholders who can’t attend the meeting can still vote by
sending in a proxy—essentially, an absentee ballot.
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION The SEC is the government agency
that oversees the trading of stocks, bonds, and other securities.
SELLING SHORT To sell a stock short is to sell it before you own it. Sounds
impossible? It’s not. Selling short is a way to make money on a stock when its price is
going down. What you do, technically, is sell stock borrowed from your broker, then buy
the same number of shares later, when the price has fallen. What happens if the price
doesn’t fall? You lose money.
STOCK SPLIT When a stock “splits two for one,” shareholders are issued an additional
share for every share they own at the time of the split. The effect is to halve the price
per share, because each share is now worth half of what it was worth when there were
only half as many. Companies generally split their stocks in order to knock the share
price down to a level at which, the company hopes, it will be more attractive to
investors.
Stock splits are sometimes referred to as stock dividends. But a stock dividend isn’t
really a dividend at all, because it doesn’t have any value.
TAX SHELTER Any investment that permits the investor to protect income from
taxation. Tax reform has eliminated most of these. Tax shelters that sound too good to
be true tend to be not only too good to be true but also illegal. There are still a lot of
humbler tax shelters, though. Buying a house is one: interest on mortgage payments is
deductible, and the resulting tax savings amounts to a federal housing subsidy for
people wealthy enough to buy their own homes.
WARRANT An option to buy a certain amount of stock at a certain price within a
certain period of time.
YIELD The annual income generated by an investment expressed as a percentage of
its cost. If a stock has a yield of 4 percent, it pays dividends equal to 4 percent of
purchase price of a share of its stock.
CHAPTER 11

Science
Here’s a list of scientific terms that turn up in newspapers and magazines with great
frequency. You won’t learn much science by learning this list, but you’ll learn some
words that may help you keep your bearings.
ABSOLUTE ZERO The temperature at which atoms become so cold they stop moving:
–459.67˚F or –273.15˚C. This is theoretically the lowest possible temperature.
ANTIBODY The key part of the immune system. An antibody is a protein produced by
the body in response to invasion of the body by a virus, bacterium, or other threatening
substance. The antibody attacks the invader and then remains in the bloodstream,
providing continuing immunity.
ANTIMATTER In effect, the mirror image of ordinary matter. Each of the elementary

genetic information.
CLONING A technology used to produce an organism that is genetically identical to
another organism.
COSMOLOGY The study of the origins, structure, and future of the universe.
DARK ENERGY A hypothetical force that some cosmologists believe counteracts
gravity and accounts for the accelerating expansion of the universe; Einstein was first
to posit the existence of dark energy, though he later referred to the idea as his
“biggest blunder.”
DARK MATTER Invisible hypothetical matter thought by some scientists to constitute
as much as 90 percent of the mass in the universe.
DNA An abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid, the substance that is the principal
component of genes; hence, DNA is the primary carrier of genetic information.
ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION Visible light, radio signals, microwaves, ultraviolet
light, and X rays are all examples of electromagnetic radiation, which is energy radiated
in waves from certain electrically charged elementary particles.
ELECTRON MICROSCOPE A device that uses streams of electrons to provide greatly
magnified images of objects far too small to be seen by the human eye or even by
ordinary optical microscopes.
ELEMENTARY PARTICLES The tiny particles that make up atoms and are thus the
building blocks of all matter. Protons, neutrons, and electrons were once believed to be
the only elementary particles, but it is now known that these particles are themselves
made up of smaller particles and that the list of elementary particles is quite long.
Among the newer additions to the list are quarks, muons, pions, gluons, positrons, and
neutrinos.
ENDORPHINS Sometimes referred to as the body’s own narcotics, endorphins are
substances produced by the pituitary gland that can reduce pain, alter moods, and
have other effects.
ENZYME Any of a large number of substances in organisms that speed up or make
possible various biological processes.
GENE A chemical pattern on a chromosome. Genes make up units of information that
govern the inheritance of all biological structures and functions.
GENETIC ENGINEERING A science devoted to altering genes in order to produce
organisms with more desirable characteristics, such as resistance to disease.
GENOME The complete set of a creature’s genes.
GREENHOUSE EFFECT The phenomenon whereby the earth’s atmosphere
(especially when altered by the addition of various pollutants) traps some of the heat of
the sun and warms the surface of the earth.
HOLOGRAM A three-dimensional image produced by a photographic process called
holography, which involves lasers.
HYDROCARBON Any of a large number of organic compounds composed of
hydrogen and carbon. Butane, methane, and propane are three of the lighter
hydrocarbons. Gasoline, kerosene, and asphalt are all mixtures of (mostly relatively
heavy) hydrocarbons.
IN VITRO FERTILIZATION The fertilization of an egg outside the mother’s body.
ISOTOPE An atom with the same number of protons as a second atom but a different
number of neutrons is said to be an isotope of that second atom.
LASER A device that produces an extraordinarily intense beam of light. The word laser
is an acronym for Light Amplification by Simulated Emission of Radiation.
LIGHT-YEAR The distance that light travels in a year, or approximately
5,878,000,000,000 miles.
NATURAL SELECTION The theory that species originate and become differentiated
as certain characteristics of organisms prove more valuable than others at enabling
those organisms to reproduce. These valuable characteristics are in effect “selected”
by nature for preservation in succeeding generations, while other characteristics
disappear. Natural selection was a key element in Charles Darwin’s monumental theory
of evolution.
NEBULA An enormous cloud of dust and gas in outer space.
NUCLEAR ENERGY The vast energy locked in the infinitesimal nucleus of an atom.
This energy can be released through fission (the splitting of certain atomic nuclei) and
fusion (the combining of certain atomic nuclei). It is also released naturally in a few
elements through a process of decomposition called radioactivity. Fission, fusion, and
radioactivity are all processes involving the conversion of small amounts of matter into
enormous amounts of energy. The release of this energy is the basis of nuclear
weapons (such as atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs) and nuclear reactors used in
the production of electricity.
NUCLEAR WINTER A hypothetical chilling of the earth resulting from the
contamination of the atmosphere by radioactive materials, dust, and other substances
in the aftermath of a nuclear war.
OSMOSIS The equalization of fluid concentrations on both sides of a permeable
membrane.
OZONE LAYER Ozone is a compound of oxygen. The ozone layer is a part of the
atmosphere that, among other things, filters out radiation that is harmful to human
beings. In recent decades the ozone layer has been found to be decomposing at an
alarming rate, owing in large part to the release of certain pollutants into the
atmosphere.
PASTEURIZATION A sterilization process in which foods are heated in order to kill
harmful organisms in them. The process is named for Louis Pasteur, the 19th-century
French scientist who developed it.
PERIODIC TABLE A chart depicting the known elements arranged according to certain
characteristics—a must-have in chemistry classrooms and textbooks.
PHEROMONE Substances secreted by animals that influence the behavior of other
animals, primarily through the sense of smell.
PHOTON The smallest unit of electromagnetic radiation.
PHOTOSYNTHESIS The process whereby green plants transform energy from the sun
into food.
PLATE TECTONICS A revolutionary geological theory holding that the earth’s crust
consists of enormous moving plates that are constantly shifting position and, among
other things, altering the shape and arrangement of the continents.
PULSAR Any of a number of less than thoroughly understood objects in outer space
that emit regular pulses of radio waves.
QUASAR Any of a number of starlike objects believed to occupy the very farthest
fringes of the universe.
RADIO TELESCOPE A large antenna capable of receiving the radio waves naturally
emitted by stars and other objects in outer space. A radio telescope is a telescope
capable of “seeing” forms of electromagnetic radiation not visible to the human eye
or to an ordinary optical telescope.
RELATIVITY Albert Einstein’s monumental theory, which holds, among a great many
other things, that space and time are not separate entities but elements of a single
continuum called space time.
RNA An abbreviation for ribonucleic acid, a substance similar to DNA that is a crucial
element in the synthesis of proteins.
SEISMOLOGY The study of earthquakes and other tremors (including man-made
ones) in the earth’s crust.
SPEED OF LIGHT The speed at which light travels through a vacuum, or 186,282
miles per second.
SUPERCONDUCTIVITY The ability of certain substances to conduct electricity with no
resistance. Superconductivity has usually been produced by cooling certain substances
to temperatures approaching absolute zero. More recently, scientists have discovered
materials that become superconductive at vastly warmer temperatures.
THERMODYNAMICS A branch of science concerned with heat and the conversion of
heat into other forms of energy.
VACCINE A substance that, when introduced into an organism, causes the organism to
produce antibodies against, and hence immunity to, a particular disease.

More Common Usage Errors
(Continued from Word Smart)
Our Common Usage Errors chapter in the original Word Smart was so popular, that
we’re back with more! Many of these errors involve confusing similar words or using
real words incorrectly—in short, they can’t be caught with the spell check on your
computer. So it’s a good idea to pay close attention to this list, and consult it frequently
next time you’re writing an important document.
A LOT A lot is always two separate words; alot is never correct.
ACCEPT/EXCEPT To accept is to receive something with consent. Except means not
including.
• We accepted all of the housewarming gifts with pleasure, except the four-foot frog
statue from my cousin.
AFFECT/EFFECT Affect is a verb meaning to cause a change. Effect is generally a
noun that means a result or consequence.
• My friend apologized for her grumpiness during her visit; apparently, the rain
negatively affected her mood.
• Because I’m from Seattle, rain has no negative effect on my mood.
ALLUSION/ILLUSION An allusion is a subtle reference. An illusion is a mirage or false
belief.
• Have you been making allusions to my earlier fall down the stairs, or is that just an
illusion of mine?
AMBIGUOUS/AMBIVALENT Ambiguous means unsure or unclear. Ambivalent means
feeling opposing things at the same time.
• The note saying that my girlfriend had left was ambiguous; I didn’t know whether
she had left for good, so I went to look for her.
• I am feeling ambivalent about my dog; I love him dearly, but I hate him for chewing
up the rug while I was at work.
COMPLEMENT/COMPLIMENT To complement is to complete. To compliment is to
praise. Both words have noun forms that are spelled and pronounced the same as the
verbs.
• Scott and Judy are getting married because they complement each other so well.
They are ideal complements.
• Blanche complimented me on my new puce shoes. I wasn’t sure about them at
first, so it was an ideal compliment.
CONTINUAL/CONTINUOUS Continual means frequently happening. Continuous
means without interruption.
• You say that I continuously correct people, but I think you actually mean
continually. Continuous means that I would never stop, which of course can’t be
true.
COULD OF/WOULD OF/SHOULD OF These phrases are never correct. The correct
phrasings are could have, would have, and should have.
DEFUSE/DIFFUSE To defuse is to remove the fuse from a bomb. Figuratively, it can
mean to avoid a difficult situation. To diffuse is to spread over a wide area.
• My boss’s email said that he wished to diffuse the tension in the department, and
sure enough, the tension was spreading at a rapid rate. I’m sure he meant to
defuse everyone’s nervousness.
DISINTERESTED/UNINTERESTED Disinterested means “having no issue of personal
gain.” Uninterested means “having no interest.”
• We intended to hire a disinterested mediator to resolve the conflict; however, he
turned out to be so uninterested in the proceedings that he fell asleep on the table
in front of us.
ELICIT/ILLICIT Elicit is a verb meaning “to draw out a response.” Illicit is an adjective
that means “illegal or unsanctioned.”
• The journalist is a master of eliciting the details of her interviewees’ affairs, no
matter how clandestine and illicit.
EMIGRATE/IMMIGRATE To emigrate is to leave a country for good. To immigrate is to
settle in a new country.
• I emigrated from Germany and immigrated to Australia.
EMINENT/IMMANENT/IMMINENT Eminent means “important.” Immanent means
“inherent.” Imminent means “about to happen.”
• Kurt became an eminent scholar in his field partly because of his immanent
passion for the topic. Once he received his first fan letter, he knew fortune beyond
his wildest dreams was imminent.
GOOD/WELL Good is an adjective. Well is an adverb. Because of a modern emphasis
on wellness, it is generally accepted to say, “I am well,” but otherwise, do not confuse
the two.
• Ashka is a good dancer. She tangos extremely well.
IT’S/ITS It’s is a contraction that stands for “it is.” Its is a possessive pronoun. To make
sure you’re using the correct one, ask yourself whether “it is” would make sense in the
sentence you’re writing. If it wouldn’t, avoid the apostrophe and use its.
• It’s unfortunate that the toy won’t even run for half an hour with its own batteries;
we need to buy some more powerful ones.
MORAL/MORALE Moral means “concerned with right and wrong.” Morale means
“spirit or enthusiasm.”
• The fact that - made it to the top of the sales team damaged the morale of
his coworkers; they were dispirited to see someone succeed who had such a
skewed moral sense.
NAUSEATED/NAUSEOUS Although this one is sometimes disputed, many grammar
experts say that the correct meaning of nauseated is “inclined to throw up.” Meanwhile,
according to the experts, nauseous describes something that makes you want to throw
up.
• The nauseous odor from the strong cheese made me feel nauseated.
PRINCIPAL/PRINCIPLE A principal is an important person in an organization. A
principle is a fundamental truth.
• The principals all rose to the top of the dance company because of their
dedication to the principle of hard work.
RESPECTABLY/RESPECTFULLY/RESPECTIVELY Respectably means “worthy of
respect.” Respectfully means “showing respect.” Respectively means “in the order
given.”
• Respectably and respectfully mean worthy of respect and showing respect,
respectively.
SIMPLE/SIMPLISTIC Simple means “uncomplicated”; it generally does not have a
negative connotation unless a person is being called simple. Simplistic means “so
uncomplicated that the author didn’t really understand the issue.”
• The new budget is simple to implement and it meets the needs of the entire
organization well.
• The new budget is so simplistic that there are many areas of the organization that
will not have their needs addressed.
THAN/THEN Than is used to show a comparison. Then is used to indicate a certain
time or an effect.
• If she thinks I’m uglier than a gorilla, then I guess we won’t be going to the prom
together.
THEIR/THERE/THEY’RE Their is a plural, possessive pronoun. There generally
indicates a place or a certain point. They’re is a contraction that stands for they are.
• I didn’t get an invitation to their party.
• It’s being held at the pavilion, and I don’t usually go there.
• Besides, they’re not the nicest people to hang around.
TO/TOO/TWO To is a preposition indicating motion in a certain direction. Too means
“also” or “excessively.” Two is a number.
• I am going to the party anyway.
• Do you want to come too?
• It’s too early to call it a night.
• Maybe I’ll even bring two other friends.
WEATHER/WETHER/WHETHER Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a
particular place and time. A wether is a castrated ram, so its use in business and
academic writing is limited (and luckily, most spell checkers will correct you on this
one). Whether is a conjunction that shows a choice, and it is not necessary to follow it
up with “or not.”
• The weather is a little cloudy, so I am undecided whether we should go to the
beach.
WHERE AT This is redundant and often causes writers and speakers to end sentences
with prepositions. Just drop the at, and instead of saying, “Where’s the food at?” say,
“Where’s the food?”
YOU’RE/YOUR You’re is a contraction that stands for “you are.” Your is a possessive
pronoun.
• You’re most welcome to accompany me.
• I find your company more tolerable than that of anyone else I know.

CHAPTER 4
More SAT Key Terms
(Continued from Word Smart)
Here’s what we said in Word Smart about vocabulary for the SAT:
Despite all the talk about “scholastic aptitude” and “reasoning ability,” much of the
Critical Reading and Writing sections of the SAT is essentially a vocabulary test. If you
don’t know the words on the test, you won’t earn a good score. It’s as simple as that.
If you learn every word on the main word list in this book, you’ll have a big advantage
on the SAT. The bigger your vocabulary, the better you’ll do. But not every word on the
main list is the sort of word that is tested on the SAT. If you’re getting ready to take the
SAT or a similar standardized test, you should focus your attention on the words in the
following list.
The Key Terms is a list of the words tested most frequently on the SAT. Princeton
Review students use the Key Terms to get the maximum possible mileage out of their
vocabularies and improve their verbal SAT scores. Not all Key Terms appear on our
main word list, but all of them have appeared on SATs.
We’ve included short definitions to make it easier for you to learn the words. These
definitions aren’t always exactly like the ones you’ll find in the dictionary or the main
word list of this book; they’re the definitions of the words as they are tested on the SAT.
Keep in mind that these are not the only words you need to know for the SAT. They’re
just the words that have been tested most frequently in the past—the words that the
Educational Testing Service’s question writers tend to come back to over and over
again. Also keep in mind that the words near the top of the list are more likely to turn up
than the words near the bottom.
Some SATs are absolutely loaded with Key Terms; others don’t contain as many. One
of the most important things the Key Terms will teach you is the level of the vocabulary
on the test. Once you get a feel for this level, you’ll be able to spot other possible SAT
words in your reading.
The list of Key Terms in this book is a continuation of the list in Word Smart (make sure
you’ve learned the Key Terms from that book, too). We have included parts of speech
when clarification is needed.
Start at the beginning and work your way through the list. Steady, consistent practice is
better than trying to memorize several hundred words the week before the big day. If
the SAT is coming up in the next few months, make sure you learn at least five to ten
words per day.

CHAPTER 6
Word Roots You Should Know
Here is a list of the most helpful roots to know. It is the same list that appears in Word
Smart. As we said there, learning roots helps you memorize words. When you look up
the definition of a word on this list, try to relate that definition to the meaning of the root.
You should recognize these roots in new words, but don’t struggle to memorize their
definitions. These roots are in thousands of words you already know. You simply have
to become aware of them.
Some students go through these lists one root at a time; they look up all the words
under one root and learn the definitions together. That way they can link the meanings
of different but related words. Linking words together improves your understanding and
helps you remember better.
Note: Some roots words have more than one spelling. We have listed the most
common forms of each.

CHAPTER 1
Why More Word Smart?
About Word Smart
We wrote the first Word Smart thinking it would be our only vocabulary book. Most
vocabulary books include too many words that people rarely use, and not enough of
the words people actually encounter in school or in their daily lives. For Word Smart,
we wanted only the most important words in an educated vocabulary, the words people
truly need to know to do well in school and in their careers.
Here’s what we said on the back cover of Word Smart:
Improving your vocabulary is important, but where do you start? The
English language has hundreds of thousands of words. To find out which
words you absolutely need to know, The Princeton Review researched
the vocabularies of educated adults. We analyzed newspapers from The
- Times to The Wall Street Journal, magazines from Time to
Scientific American, and books from current bestsellers to the classics.
We threw out the words that most people know and focused on the
words that people misunderstand or misuse. From these, we selected
the 823 words that appeared most frequently.
Since we first wrote those words, hundreds of thousands of people have purchased
Word Smart. Many of them, having learned the words in the first volume, did not want
to stop there. They asked us for other important words they should know.
So we set out to collect another batch of words. We went through the same research
process we did when compiling our first volume. We still concentrated on the words
that occurred most frequently, but there were some important differences in the way we
made our final selection.
The World Has Changed
In the first place, the world has changed a lot. With the international upheavals of
recent years, many political and religious words gained increasing usage. Increasing
globalization made us more aware of foreign languages, and as a result many foreign
words and phrases gained popularity.
We Know More About People’s
Vocabularies
Another consideration affecting the words we selected was our growing experience
with students and adults and their use and misuse of language. Many important words
in More Word Smart failed to make the cut for the first volume because we thought that
most educated people use these words correctly. We were wrong.
We discovered that many students and adults learn words from context. They figure
out the definition of difficult words from the general meaning of the sentences or
paragraphs containing them. Unfortunately, this often gives a vague understanding; at
best, a word’s context will provide only a general idea of its meaning. This volume
contains many deceivingly simple words that educated people misuse, misunderstand,
or confuse with other words.
We’ve also included a chapter near the end of this book that focuses exclusively on
usage errors. It’s a continuation of the Common Usage Errors chapter in the original
Word Smart.
We Want Our Readers to Use These
Words
The last major difference in writing More Word Smart is that we wanted to place greater
emphasis on pronunciation. The speaking vocabularies of most people, the words they
use in everyday speech, are much smaller than the number of words they actually
know. Even highly educated people avoid saying many of the words they know simply
because they aren’t sure how to pronounce them.
In researching the correct pronunciation of the More Word Smart words, we were
astonished—we ourselves had been confidently mispronouncing dozens of words for
years! (Fortunately, nobody seemed to notice since just about all our educated friends
had been mispronouncing these words right along with us.)
We’ve gone to great lengths to emphasize correct pronunciation so you won’t
embarrass yourself when you speak up in class or try to impress your friends with your
growing linguistic virtuosity.
More Word Smart Versus Word Smart
The words in this volume are just as important as the words in our first book. The
words here are perhaps a bit more difficult and appear somewhat less frequently, but
they all belong in an educated vocabulary. For variety, this book also contains new
drills to help you learn and remember the words.
We assume that you have already read the original Word Smart. In it, we outlined
various methods for learning and memorizing new words, as well as the best way to
use the dictionary and thesaurus. In case you haven’t read our first vocabulary book,
the following is a summary of the main points and techniques we discussed.
Summary of Word Smart
1. Learning new words should be fun, not drudgery. Children learn new words so
quickly because they have a keen interest in the world around them and in
communicating with others. Become receptive to the words around you.
2. The words you use say a lot about you. Your vocabulary is the foundation of your
ability to think and your ability to share your thoughts with other people.
• The number of words you know is less important than the care you take in
understanding the ones you already know.
• Big, important-sounding words are not necessarily better. A good vocabulary
consists of words that educated people use in everyday life.
• Read well-written newspapers, magazines, and books. Make the effort to be
aware of new words and learn them from context.
3. Use a dictionary to verify meanings—and pronunciations—of words that you’ve
learned from context.
• Simply reading the dictionary is a pretty inefficient way to learn new words. This
is because most dictionaries discuss only the meanings of words, and not the
context in which these words are used.
• Not all dictionaries have the same features. Check to make sure that your
dictionary includes word etymologies (the history of the words’ origins). Ideally,
it should also indicate proper usage of synonyms or related words.
• Don’t stop at the first definition you read. Be sure to look up secondary
meanings and parts of speech. Note the etymology to see what other words the
word is related to. And practice pronunciation! (You can find good pronunciation
guides online at
• Consider purchasing a good portable paperback or electronic dictionary so you
can immediately confirm definitions you encounter in everyday life.
4. Synonyms are not interchangeable! Use a thesaurus to find the precise word to
capture your meaning, but be sure to verify its exact definition and usage in a
dictionary.
• The exact word you want to use depends not only on its meaning and
connotation, but also on the overall rhythm, vocabulary level, variety, and effect
you are trying to achieve.
5. Memorizing a word using mnemonics, creating wacky mental images, and
examining etymologies can be helpful.
• Mnemonics are memorization devices that typically work by associating
something you’re trying to remember with an already familiar idea, image, or
pattern (such as a rhyming scheme). “Spring forward, fall back” is an example
of a mnemonic.
• The etymology, or root origins, of a word will help your understanding and
memory by relating the word to others you already know. The meanings of
mnemonic, amnesia, and amnesty, for example, all have to do with memory.
• Careful! Etymology can sometimes be misleading because the meaning and
connotation of a word change over the centuries.
6. Use flash cards to review new words. Be creative when writing the flash card:
Colors and drawings will help you remember the word.
7. Keep a notebook of the words you learn. Strive to learn five to ten words per day.
8. Use new words you’ve learned in everyday conversation. It may feel artificial at
first, but there is no other way to make them a part of your more natural-feeling
vocabulary.
How We Wrote the Word Smart
Definitions and Entries
Each entry begins with the preferred pronunciation of the word. We say “preferred”
because, depending on the dictionary you use, a word can be pronounced several
ways. When a dictionary lists more than one pronunciation, the first is the preferred
pronunciation. The trouble is that excellent dictionaries often disagree about the
preferred pronunciation. Consulting numerous sources, we chose the pronunciation
preferred by the majority of experts. So stick with our pronunciation and you’ll never
embarrass yourself. Say each word aloud several times. This will help you remember
the meaning of the word as well as its pronunciation.
Note the part of speech following the pronunciation. Many words can be used as nouns
and verbs, or verbs and adjectives, and the pronunciations often vary depending on the
usages.
After the part of speech, we provide the definition and synonyms, often using Word
Smart words. Sometimes we deliberately use a difficult word in our definition to help
you relate the listing with other words you ought to know.
The trouble with dictionaries is that they rarely illustrate the correct usage of a word.
We believe that you need to see a word used in a concrete context in order to
understand it. So following the definition, you will find at least one or two sentences
illustrating the proper usage of a word.
When it will help you remember or understand a word, we discuss its history or relate it
to other important words.
Finally, we list different parts of speech. Whenever a different part of speech is
pronounced differently from the main listing, we provide a separate pronunciation.
How You Should Use This Book
Some people approach the word list from the beginning and go all the way through to
the end. While this is a thorough approach, it may be quicker to use the Quick Quizzes
throughout to hone in on the words you need help with. Some Princeton Review
students start with the Final Exam Drills that appear at the end of the book. They take
one of these quizzes and then look up any words they get wrong. Other students use
the list of roots at the end of the book and learn groups of related words together.
Students studying for the SAT or GRE can turn immediately to Chapters 4 and 5. (The
original Word Smart has more SAT- and GRE-specific lists, and if you want plenty of
serious vocabulary work for the GRE, be sure to check out our Word Smart for the
GRE.)
What we’re basically saying is this: Any way you want to use this book is fine—just use
it!
Our Pronunciation Key
We’ve never liked the pronunciation keys most dictionaries use. This may offend
pedants and lexicographers, but we have decided to use a simplified pronunciation key.
Our key is based on consistent phonetic sounds so you don’t have to memorize it. Still,
it would be a good idea to take a few minutes now to familiarize yourself with it
(especially the e and the i):
The letter(s) is (are) pronounced like the
letter(s)
in the word(s)
a a bat, can
ah o con, bond
aw aw paw, straw
ay a skate, rake
i i rim, chin, hint
ing ing sing, ring
oh o row, tow
oo oo room, boom
ow ow cow, brow
oy oy boy, toy
u, uh u run, bun
y (ye, eye) i climb, time
ch ch chair, chin
f f, ph film, phony
g g go, goon
j j join, jungle
k c cool, cat
s s solid, wisp
sh sh shoe, wish
z z zoo, razor
zh s measure
All other consonants are pronounced as you would expect. Capitalized letters indicate
the accented syllable in a word.
The Princeton Review Approach
The philosophy behind The Princeton Review is simple: We teach exactly what
students need to know, and we make our courses smart, efficient, and fun. We were
founded in the early 1980s, and just a few years later, we grew to have the largest SAT
course in the country. Our success is indisputable. We’re proud to compare our results
with those of any preparation course in the nation. In addition, our first book, Cracking
the SAT, was the first of its kind to appear on The - Times best-seller list.
Our innovative method of teaching vocabulary is responsible for much of our success.
Many of the questions on standardized tests are really vocabulary questions, such as
the vocabulary-in-context items on the Verbal portions of the SAT. To score high on
these tests, students need to know the right words.
We’ve put a lot of thought into how people learn—and remember—new words. The
methods we’ve developed are easy to use and, we believe, extremely effective.
There’s nothing particularly startling about them. But they do work. And although they
were developed primarily for high school students, they can be used profitably by
anyone who wants to build a stronger, smarter vocabulary.
